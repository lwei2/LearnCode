#u Calculate e
Problem Description
A simple mathematical formula for e is sum
where n is allowed to go to infinity. This can actually yield very accurate approximations of e using relatively small values of n.

Output
Output the approximations of e generated by the above formula for the values of n from 0 to 9. The beginning of your output should appear similar to that shown below.

Sample Output
