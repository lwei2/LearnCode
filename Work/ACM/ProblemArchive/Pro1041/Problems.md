# Computer Transformation
Problem Description
A sequence consisting of one digit, the number 1 is initially written into a computer. At each successive time step, the computer simultaneously tranforms each digit 0 into the sequence 1 0 and each digit 1 into the sequence 0 1. So, after the first time step, the sequence 0 1 is obtained; after the second, the sequence 1 0 0 1, after the third, the sequence 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 and so on. 

How many pairs of consequitive zeroes will appear in the sequence after n steps? 
 

Input
Every input line contains one natural number n (0 < n â‰¤1000).
 

Output
For each input n print the number of consecutive zeroes pairs that will appear in the sequence after n steps.
