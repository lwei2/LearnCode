# Rightmost Digit
# Problem Description
Given a positive integer N, you should output the most right digit of N^N.
 

Input
The input contains several test cases. The first line of the input is a single integer T which is the number of test cases. T test cases follow.
Each test case contains a single positive integer N(1<=N<=1,000,000,000).
 

Output
For each test case, you should output the rightmost digit of N^N.

Sample Input
2
3
4
 

Sample Output
7
6

Hint

In the first case, 3 * 3 * 3 = 27, so the rightmost digit is 7.
In the second case, 4 * 4 * 4 * 4 = 256, so the rightmost digit is 6.
