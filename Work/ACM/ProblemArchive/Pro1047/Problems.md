# Integer Inquiry
# Problem Description
One of the first users of BIT's new supercomputer was Chip Diller. He extended his exploration of powers of 3 to go from 0 to 333 and he explored taking various sums of those numbers. 
``This supercomputer is great,'' remarked Chip. ``I only wish Timothy were here to see these results.'' (Chip moved to a new apartment, once one became available on the third floor of the Lemon Sky apartments on Third Street.) 

# Input
The input will consist of at most 100 lines of text, each of which contains a single VeryLongInteger. Each VeryLongInteger will be 100 or fewer characters in length, and will only contain digits (no VeryLongInteger will be negative). 

The final input line will contain a single zero on a line by itself.

# Output
Your program should output the sum of the VeryLongIntegers given in the input. 


This problem contains multiple test cases!

The first line of a multiple input is an integer N, then a blank line followed by N input blocks. Each input block is in the format indicated in the problem description. There is a blank line between input blocks.

The output format consists of N output blocks. There is a blank line between output blocks.
