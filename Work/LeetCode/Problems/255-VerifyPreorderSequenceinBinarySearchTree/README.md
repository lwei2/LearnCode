#  Verify Preorder Sequence in Binary Search Tree 验证二叉搜索树的先序序列
Given an array of numbers, verify whether it is the correct preorder traversal sequence of a binary search tree.

You may assume each number in the sequence is unique.

Consider the following binary search tree: 

     5
    / \
   2   6
  / \
 1   3
Example 1:

Input: [5,2,6,1,3]
Output: false
Example 2:

Input: [5,2,1,3,6]
Output: true
